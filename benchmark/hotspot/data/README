Format for train/input.txt:
    - first line is the number of data
    - for the rest of the line, each line is one data
        each data has 10 values, which is the value of 10 input neurons

Format for train/golden.txt:
    - first line is the number of data
        (should be the same as the first line in input.txt)
    - for the rest of the line, each line is one data
        each data has 1 value, which is used to compare with the output neuron value

Format for train/train_result/*:
    - these file are output files generated from Neural Networks
        accuracies come from the comparison between these files and train/golden.txt
    - each line is one data
        each data has 1 value, which is the value of the output neuron
